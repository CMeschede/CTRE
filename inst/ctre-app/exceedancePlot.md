### The POT (Points over Threshold) model

A Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution is fitted to the exceedance times of the threshold crossings.

* From left to right, the threshold is lowered; the x-axis shows the number `k` of exceedances.
* At each threshold height, a GP distribution is fitted to the `k` exceedances.

Towards the left, the plot becomes "unstable". Read off the parameters of the GP distribution before they become "unstable" (yes, this can be tricky).
