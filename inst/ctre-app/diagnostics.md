### Checking model assumptions

The QQ-Plot shows sample quantiles (from the dataset) plotted against population quantiles (from the Mittag-Leffler distribution; try different values for the `tail parameter`).

The auto-correlation function of the logarithms of the inter-exceedance times "checks" the i.i.d. assumption of a renewal process.
