### Bursty Extremes

The given datasets exhibit "bursty" behaviour:

* events occur at highly heterogeneous frequencies
* there are extended periods in which no large events occur

The simulated datasets are drawn from a renewal process with heavy-tailed waiting times (the lower the `tail parameter`, the heavier), and the magnitudes are i.i.d. exponential.
